# sfsu-csc413-group-projects
Uploading the group projects from a spring 2020 software development class. This, more than any other class I've taken, really got me interested in the processes of software development and design, design patterns, team-oriented development, creating and using APIs, etc. These might be rough around the edges, but given that we were largely working remotely and entirely as a team for the first time, I'm ultimately pretty happy with the work we did.

Because the original repositories were private and in a git classroom, I've been unable to properly import all the commits that actually took place during that semester as of yet.
